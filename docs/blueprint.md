# **App Name**: Script Stylist

## Core Features:

- Script Upload & Processing: Upload and process .docx script files to identify character dialogues.
- Character Identification: Automatically identify characters and their dialogues within the script using a generative AI tool, with a confidence score for each identified character.
- Character Management: Allow users to review identified characters, manually add new characters, and delete incorrectly identified characters.
- Dialogue Highlighting: Automatically assign and apply distinct highlight colors to each character's dialogue for easy visual differentiation. Color assignment is done heuristically (deterministic), not via the AI tool.
- Filtered Views: Provide options to filter the script view by character, showing only the lines for a selected character.
- Export Options: Enable users to export character lines in isolation or the entire filtered script view to .txt files.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted purple (#A893B3), providing a sophisticated and calming base.
- Background color: Very light grayish-purple (#F4F2F5), offering a subtle contrast without distracting from the highlighted script.
- Accent color: Teal (#69B0AB), to highlight important controls and actionable elements, drawing the eye without overwhelming the design.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for clear readability in both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying sample scripts.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to represent actions and characters.
- Maintain a clean, spacious layout that improves readability, using clear visual hierarchy to guide users.
